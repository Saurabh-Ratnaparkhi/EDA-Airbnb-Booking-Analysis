It involved collecting data, identifying trends, assessing impacts on housing and tourism, and providing policy recommendations. Visualizations and reports were created to present findings clearly.

Various python libraries are used like numpy and pandas to collect the data along with that the libraries like seaborn and matplotlib help me to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and impact on the city's economy and communities.

The goal was to optimize the client's Airbnb business in NYC by improving occupancy rates, profitability, and guest satisfaction through data-driven strategies.
